Render the review table using the format defined in [review table format](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/learn_review_table.md). Use `AskUserQuestion` once to collect the user's accept / reject / add response.

Do not prompt per row. Do not inline the column-by-column documentation here — the template owns the format, the accept/reject syntax, and the user-added-row split rule.

The confirmed response is what the exit edge's first gate names — record it. Nothing is written in this step.
